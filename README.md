# Healthcare Accessibility & Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes healthcare accessibility and performance across different regions by examining key indicators such as funding levels, healthcare workforce availability (doctors and nurses), emergency response time, and patient satisfaction rates.  
The goal is to identify disparities between regions and provide data-driven insights to support better healthcare planning and resource allocation.



## Objectives
- Compare healthcare funding across regions
- Analyze the distribution of doctors and nurses per region
- Evaluate emergency response time differences
- Assess patient satisfaction rates across regions
- Identify underserved regions and key accessibility gaps



## Dataset
The dataset includes regional healthcare metrics such as:
- Healthcare funding allocation
- Number of doctors per region
- Number of nurses per region
- Average emergency response time (minutes)
- Patient satisfaction rate (%)





## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboards  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing  
 



## Key Metrics Analyzed
- Funding per capita
- Doctor-to-patient ratio
- Nurse-to-patient ratio
- Average emergency response time
- Patient satisfaction score



## Key Insights
- Regions with higher healthcare funding generally had better staff availability and shorter emergency response times.
- Underserved regions showed lower doctor and nurse density, leading to longer emergency response times.
- Faster emergency response times were positively correlated with higher patient satisfaction rates.
- Some regions achieved high patient satisfaction despite lower funding, suggesting operational efficiency or effective resource management.



## Visualizations Included
- Regional funding comparison (Bar/Map visualization)
- Doctors and nurses distribution by region
- Emergency response time comparison across regions
- Patient satisfaction rate by region
- KPI dashboard summarizing accessibility gaps



## Recommendations
- Increase funding and workforce allocation in underserved regions.
- Invest in emergency response infrastructure to reduce response times.
- Implement best practices from high-performing regions with lower funding.
- Use patient satisfaction feedback to guide service improvement initiatives.



## Conclusion
This analysis highlights significant disparities in healthcare accessibility across regions. By leveraging data visualization and analytics, stakeholders can better understand where interventions are needed most and make informed decisions to improve healthcare outcomes.
